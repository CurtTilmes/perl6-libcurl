The tests in this directory mirror and rely on the test infrastructure
from curl itself.

https://github.com/curl/curl/

To make it work, check out that GIT repository beside perl6-libcurl
itself, and build/test curl independently.

Once that works, you can "prove lt" from perl6-libcurl.  It uses a
little helper module LibCurl::Test.pm which starts up the various
servers within the curl test infrastructure, reads their diagnostics,
etc. to enable the tests here.

You can read the actual test cases themselves in the curl/tests/data/*
files (format described in curl/tests/FILEFORMAT).

Also note these tests will only work serially.  If you run them in
parallel, they will stomp on one another.  Don't do that.
